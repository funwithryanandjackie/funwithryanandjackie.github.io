                        There are lots of fun things to do in the area so we may organize a hike/bike or something of the sort.
                        Bring your fishing rod if you’re a keen fisherman (although it's catch and release).
                        We might also take a dip in the dam or swimming pool so bring your cozy’s and lots of sun cream, I’m sure it’s going to be piping hot!
